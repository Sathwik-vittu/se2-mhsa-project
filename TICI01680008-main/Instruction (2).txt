Title: Mental Health Support Application

The purpose of this project is to develop a software application that supports individuals experiencing mental health challenges. The app will provide tools for personal health management, medication reminders, appointment scheduling, and peer support via a moderated forum. This project serves as a semester-long exercise in requirements engineering, project management, and software testing.
1. Scope
* Target Platform: Preferred: Mobile app (Android/iOS). Acceptable: Web app. Allowed but not encouraged: Desktop app.
* Core Features:
o Secure collection of user demographic and medical/psychiatric history.
o Medication management with optional reminders.
o Calendar for healthcare appointments with notifications.
o Community support forum with posting and reply features, moderated for safety by a provided local LLM API.
* Constraints:
o Use open-source solutions whenever possible.
o Sensitive user information must be stored securely with appropriate safeguards.
o All forum posts must be checked for safety before being published.

1.1 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
* LLM: Large Language Model, used for content moderation.
* UI/UX: User Interface / User Experience.
* HIPAA (for context only): Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, standard for handling sensitive health data.

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The application is a stand-alone system that:
* Interacts with the user via a mobile or web interface.
* Connects to a backend database for secure storage.
* Calls an LLM moderation API (provided by instructor) before posting forum content.
2.2 Product Functions
* Collect and store user demographics and medical history.
* Manage medications (logging, reminders, refill alerts, doctor contact reminders).
* Provide a personal calendar for health appointments with alerts.
* Support community discussions by allowing users to post new threads and reply to existing messages, with moderation for safety.
2.3 User Characteristics
* End users may vary in age, background, and digital literacy.
* Users are expected to have mobile device or web access.
* Some users may have limited technical skills; the UI should be intuitive and accessible.
2.4 Constraints
* Sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
* All forum content must pass moderation before display.
* Development must use open-source technologies where feasible.
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
* The instructor will provide an API endpoint for LLM moderation.
* Users will have consistent internet access for app functionality.
* The project is for educational purposes and not intended for production healthcare use.

Tools to Use for Design and Development
* You must use some UML CASE tools to make your analysis and design, such as StarUML and IBM Rational Rose.
* You must use Microsoft Project to work out your workplan and use MS Project to keep track of the progress of your project.
* You may use Microsoft Visio to draw Entity-Relation diagrams (ERDs), and data flow diagrams (DFDs). 
* You must use some Unit Test tools (e.g., Pytest, JUnit, CppUnit, etc.) to perform formal testing.
